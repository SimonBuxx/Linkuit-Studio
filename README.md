## How to compile

*Qt Creator for open source* can be downloaded here: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer

I am using **Qt Creator 4.15.0** on Windows with **Qt v6.1.0**. The compiler I use is **MinGW 64-bit**.
After installing Qt Creator, the **.pro** file can be opened with Qt Creator, from where you can compile the project.
